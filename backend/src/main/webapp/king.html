                <h1>King</h1>

                <p>The King is a unique piece that has the same maneuverability as the queen but can only move 1 square at a
                    time. The king however, does not play an offensive role but rather stays in the back protected by the other
                    pieces. They are the ultimate goal to take by you and your opponent as putting a king in check-mate wins the game.</p>

                <p>Check is when you or your opponent set up your pieces so that the king has to be moved to avoid capture, a piece
                    has to be used to protect the king by either taking out the piece that is causing check or by blocking the piece.
                    The king can also take out pieces that are putting it in check depending on position.</p>

                <p>Check-mate is when you or your opponent has set up a stance where the king cannot move to avoid being captured, a
                    piece cannot be used to protect the king and a piece or king cannot take out the piece that is putting the king in
                    check.</p>
