                <h1>Pawn</h1>

                <p>The Pawn is the front of your chess army, also making up the largest number of pieces at 8. They are also
                    the weakest part of the army, being limited to moving 1 square forward(2 optionally at the start). They
                    also can only take pieces in a diagonal square infront of them. This makes them quite situational but
                    they can also be used to fill out the board and limit moves of your opponent.</p>

                <p>If a pawn reaches the end of the pawn, they can also be promoted. Promotion means the chess piece takes
                    on the abilities of another piece. Most players use a promotion to turn a pawn to a queen, as it is the
                    most powerful piece but a player can have any amount. There is no limit to the amount of pieces a player
                    can have promoted e.g. a player could theoretically have 9 Queens if all pawns get promoted to Queen.</p>

                <p>Pawns can also perform an en passant. This occurs when a player moves their pawn 2 squares foward to avoid
                    capture when if they moved 1 square forward, their opponent could of captured it. The opponent moves to the
                    square behind the pawn, and the pawn is captured.</p>

                <p>If the player does not perform this move immediately, they lose the option to do so it is advised to
                    take out the piece unless you want to save your pawn from being taken out in the next turn.</p>
